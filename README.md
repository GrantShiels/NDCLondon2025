# High Performance .NET Workshop

## NDC London 2025

Hello lovely workshop people! We're going to have a fun couple of days.

I'd recommend forking this repository to your own account, cloning that, then working on a branch called `workshop`.

I'll be pushing changes to this repo on a branch called `demo`. You can
add this repo as an `upstream` branch to pull those changes into your own
repo if you want.

### You will need:

- Laptop: Windows, macOS or Linux are all fine
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Your favourite editor:
  - Visual Studio 2022 17.12 or later
  - Jetbrains Rider 2024.3 or later
  - Current VS Code
  - Or whatever you prefer!
- Docker of some kind (e.g. Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, Podman...)
